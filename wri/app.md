## Applications

Applications that may be built atop AORTA:

* Online maps should better account for the relative accessibility, safety,
  etc.  of different routes; e.g., Google Maps currently routes walkers through
  Tompkins Sq Pk in the wee hours of weekend mornings.  Crowd-sourced data is
  available from [Project Sidewalk]( ittp://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/ ), Open
  Street Maps, etc.

* Payments
  - PCI ≡ Payment Card Industry
  - DSS ≡ Data Security Standard
