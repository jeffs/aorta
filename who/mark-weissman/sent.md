Hi Mark, sorry for the slow reply.

After much thought, I do not believe you and I are the right team to tackle this project.  Our conversations have been based on gut feel, rather than evidence, and have not led to any concrete progress.  While I respect your opinions -- you are clearly a bright guy -- I need someone to help formulate and test hypotheses (like whether there is sufficient demand to justify building the product in the first place), contribute to operational planning, and drive early revenue, rather than simply discussing broad strokes.

I am always happy to grab a drink with you.  I hope you will keep in touch, and maybe we can work together in the future.

Sincerely,
Jeff
