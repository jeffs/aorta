Mark had expressed interest in working together, and I told him about
Aorta at length.  We met periodically over a period of months.  Finally, a
few weeks ago, I suggested we begin committing to deliverables according to
a preset timeline.  I committed to have a custom, working Alexa skill.  I
asked him to prepare one-page user models for likely target customers, and
he agreed to do so.  We met in midtown (per his request) a week and a half
later, at which point he had no user models.  He did some hand-waving, and
suggested we go after government and finance, as though these were novel
ideas (which they were not).

I emailed Mark the contents of sent.md, to which he sent reply.md.
